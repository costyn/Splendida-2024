# Seamless Paper Diffusor

This is (in my opinion) nicest diffusor, it is seamless and assembled with no visible screws.

## Instructions
- 3D print the Frame in the desired outside color.
- Print the spacer in white PLA.
- Print the Stand.
- Cut out and insert a piece of white baking/oven paper into the frame.
- Lay the Spacer on top of the paper
- Lay the PCB on top of the spacer
- Use 3 M2x6mm screws to fasten the PCB to the frame.

See pictures in the folder.
