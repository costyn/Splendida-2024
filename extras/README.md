# Extras

A folder with extra's to go with the PCB. Various models for diffusors, but my biased opinion is that my Paper Diffusor is the nicest! :)

## 2D Images
Various PDF/DXF/SVG images for use in CAD etc

## Paper Diffusor (best one ;)
Diffuse through thin paper (very nice!) with seamless screws and invisible screws

## Basic Diffusor
Diffuse through 3d printed PLA

## Ldirko's Diffusor
Also uses paper, but more parts and visible screws.

- OpenSCAD file 
- STL file of the PCB, for modelling reference
